# Basic Introduction
1. In internet, all devices connected are called hosts or end systems.
2. End systems are connected with **communication links** and packet swithes.
## Communication links:
- e.g. coaxial cable, copper wires, optical fiber & radio spectrum.
- Transmission rate: bits/second.
- Packages of information called as packets, with additional header and merged back at the destination.
## Packet Swithes:
- e.g. routers(used in access networks) and link-layer switches(used in network core).
- route/path: Communication links and packet switches traced by packets.
