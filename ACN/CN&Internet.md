# Basic Introduction
1. In internet, all devices connected are called hosts or end systems.
2. End systems are connected with **communication links** and packet swithes.
## Communication links:
- e.g. coaxial cable, copper wires, optical fiber & radio spectrum.
- Transmission rate: bits/second.
- Packages of information called as packets, with additional header and merged back at the destination.
## Packet Swithes:
- e.g. routers(used in access networks) and link-layer switches(used in network core).
- route/path: Communication links and packet switches traced by packets.

3. Lower tier ISP are connected with higher tier ISP, which consists of high-speed fiber optic link.
4. TCP and IP are the principal protocol collectively called TCP/IP stack.
- Protocols are defined by IETF(Internet Engineering Task Force), public RFC(Request for Comments)s for resolving problems with protocols.
- They define protocols like TCP, IP, HTTP, SMTP, etc.
- IEEE also defines some protocols like LAN/MAN standards, specifying ethernet and wireless WiFi standards.
